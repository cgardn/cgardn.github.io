new personal site

- one page
	- bio
	- projects
	- contact
- desktop
	- 3 section buttons toggle slide/fade content into left panel
	
- mobile
	- hamburger menu with 3 section buttons, same slide/fade transition on content but now mobile
		- menu also has the light/dark theme switcher

- vaguely sci-fi design, animations on some accent lines around edges of boxes (only 2 sides, i.e. sci-fi UI) on transitions
- hover transitions on buttons
- something subtle that draws attention somewhere, like a subtle animation of the linkedin logo when hovering last resume paragraph or something
	
nice to haves for showing off skills
- dark/light theme switcher
- colorblind options
- accessibility mode
