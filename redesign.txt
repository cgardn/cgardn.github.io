TODOs
- replace burger icon with SVG
- replace name title with animated fancy svg
- dark/light mode
- set to dark mode initially
- toggle for light/dark mode
- contact form
- add resume
- add portfolio page w/ link to O/S page and hyperchef w/ disclaimer
- rewrite bio?
- add content and menu border animations + hover states
- animate portrait up when changing off Bio slide
	- manage height of slides so that the content block isn't huge from resume section, so animating away the portrait and name title gives the room
	  for the resume
- shrink portrait on mobile?

- one page
	- bio
	- projects
	- contact
- desktop
	- 3 section buttons toggle slide/fade content into left panel
	
- mobile
	- hamburger menu with 3 section buttons, same slide/fade transition on content but now mobile
		- menu also has the light/dark theme switcher

- vaguely sci-fi design, animations on some accent lines around edges of boxes (only 2 sides, i.e. sci-fi UI) on transitions
- hover transitions on buttons
- something subtle that draws attention somewhere, like a subtle animation of the linkedin logo when hovering last resume paragraph or something
	
nice to haves for showing off skills
- dark/light theme switcher
- colorblind options
- accessibility mode
