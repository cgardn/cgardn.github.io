new personal site


TODOs
- replace burger icon with SVG
- replace name title with animated fancy svg
- dark/light mode
- set to dark mode initially
- toggle for light/dark mode
- contact form
- add resume
- add portfolio page w/ link to O/S page and hyperchef w/ disclaimer
- rewrite bio?
- add content and menu border animations + hover states
- animate portrait up when changing off Bio slide
	- manage height of slides so that the content block isn't huge from resume section, so animating away the portrait and name title gives the room
	  for the resume
- shrink portrait on mobile?
- add an extra display: none class, put it on everything that depends on JS like the light-mode switcher, then onload just remove it
- figure out how to animate down 10px on content-out, and from right 10px on content-in
	-- problem: since the slides are flex-positioned, their "resting" position is off-screen to the right. therefore any transitions or animations
				that specify a small move like `transform: translateY(10px)` (the content-out movement) is interpreted as a move from "resting" to that, so any slide other
				than the first shoots off to the right in order to reach 10px below the resting state. however, the amount that movement needs to be adjusted in order to look
				good depends on what slide it is, as the 2nd slide needs to essentially needs a content-out move of `transform: translateX(-100%) translateY(10px)`, slide 3 needs
				`transform: translateX(-200%) translateY(10px)`, and so on. this could theoretically be done with a new keyframe for each slide, but that seems excessive.
				- a related problem is that while stylesheets can be accessed with JS and @keyframe rules can also be edited with JS, that is blocked by CORS so I can't do it on local
				dev. :(

---
- one page
	- bio
	- projects
	- contact
- desktop
	- 3 section buttons toggle slide/fade content into left panel
	
- mobile
	- hamburger menu with 3 section buttons, same slide/fade transition on content but now mobile
		- menu also has the light/dark theme switcher

- vaguely sci-fi design, animations on some accent lines around edges of boxes (only 2 sides, i.e. sci-fi UI) on transitions
- hover transitions on buttons
- something subtle that draws attention somewhere, like a subtle animation of the linkedin logo when hovering last resume paragraph or something
	
nice to haves for showing off skills
- dark/light theme switcher
- colorblind options
- accessibility mode
