## Big Projects

**[Hyperchef](https://cgardn.github.io/hyperchef/)**  
I hate hunting through paragraphs of prose on recipe sites, so I made one that cuts through the fluff. Hyperchef has a VueJS frontend, and a Ruby on Rails API-only backend. Upcoming features include meal planning, a shopping-list generator, and many more recipes!

**[List Reactor](https://cgardn.github.io/list-reactor)**  
A drag-and-drop digital todo-list/planner, sort of like a more calendar-focused Trello. It started as an experiment for learning React, but now I'm working on turning into something that at least my wife and I both want to use. Still in alpha at the moment, upcoming features include a proper backend and better customization of the lists.
