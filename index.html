				<h4>Frontend Developer: 2020 - present</h4>
				<p>
				I've worked mostly in eCommerce, for my current employer <a href="https://www.luxurybrandpartners.com" target="_blank">Luxury Brand Partners</a>.
				I develop and maintain several of our brand sites, and add smaller features to other smaller properties and marketing sites as well.
				My focus here has been on performance, as I inherited several sites that were heavy on third-party libraries, no code-splitting, and generally not optimized for mobile (which is 80%+ of our users).
				In my time, I've reduced bundle sizes by over 60% on multiple sites, and led internal efforts to implement a mobile-first content policy for images and videos. I've also developed several key features for our customers (bulk-ordering system on our Pro site), and multiple high-end interactive product launch experiences for various brands.
				Stack:
				<ul>
					<li>HTML, CSS, SVG, SASS</li>
					<li>native JS, VueJS, NodeJS, jQuery (when forced :) )</li>
					<li>Webpack, Rollup</li>
					<li>Vue Storefront, Shopify</li>
				</ul>
				Before my current employer, I developed an unreleased social media app in VueJS with a small team in 2020.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Wedding Photographer: 2017 - 2020</h4>
				<p>
				Worked for my wife at her photography business, <a href="cassiclaire.com" target="_blank">Cassi Claire Photography.</a> Traveled a lot, took a lot of pictures, ate a lot of croissants and wedding dinners, and made a lot of friends and memories along the way.
				Unfortunately, COVID put a hard stop on events for a while, which led me to web development.
				<ul>
					<li>Co-owned a small business</li>
					<li>Many hats worn: high-touch customer service, bookkeeping, CRM administration, videography.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				
				<h4>Field Engineer</h4>
				<p>
				In my previous life, I was a medical field service engineer for 5 years. I installed and maintained state-of-the-art blood chemistry analyzers and associated robotic sample management systems in NYC and NJ.
				<ul>
					<li>Complex problem solving involving root-cause analysis, and deep knowledge of electro-mechanical-fluidic systems, plus a dash of chemistry and statistics</li>
					<li>Also a lot of high-touch customers service in a high-pressure environment, the systems I worked on determined the path of patient care, and my accounts included world-renowned hospitals in NYC and the largest clinical chemistry facility in North America</li>
				</ul>

					<h2>This site :)</h2>
					<p>
					Look at those animations, so crisp! And that typography, wow, what an inspired choice!
					</p>
					<p>
					And to think, it all fits in 80kB and 50ms of load time. Incredible!
					</p>
					<p>
					No frameworks you say? Amazing! What an outstanding demonstration of this developer's full command of web standards!

					<h2>Hyperchef (pls be kind)</h2>
					<p>
					Once a dazzling display of fresh-bootcamp-grad hutzpah, it is now a sad, decommissioned, amateur attempt at a recipe organizer. Pending redesign, consider it under construction.
					</p>
					<p>
					Originally built on Vue+Rails, the coming redesign will be on React+Node because reasons.
