Well, it finally happened - I got a website! It may be a github.io site, but it's better than the big zip I had before. Most of the blog posts for a while are going to be about the only Big Project I have right now, [Hyperchef](https://hyperchef.herokuapp.com). It's a recipe site, but you'll be hearing a lot more about it in the next several posts, so I hope you like rambling thoughts on Rails app design!

That's what this blog will probably end up being: unsorted thoughts on current projects, frustration at problems I'm stuck on, jubiliation when I've solved them. Consider this less of a "10 quick tips for better coding" blog and more of a "Holy wow I can't believe I didn't think of that...well it might've taken two days but at least it's fixed now" blog.

Also, there might be pictures of my cats at some point, I haven't decided.

(but there probably will be)
