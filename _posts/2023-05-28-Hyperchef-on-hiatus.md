# A brief update

I'm taking down the Hyperchef backend to re-use those resources
for other stuff. I'll leave the site up because it's hosted for free on GH, but
don't expect to work for a while. I'd like to come back and rewrite it all 
since it was the first Big Thing I made, but there's too many other things
on my plate now so maybe later.

As for the other stuff, I've got a few other ideas I'm cooking, but work and life
keep me pretty occupied so they'll be ready Soon<sup>TM</sup>.
