Well, I guess it's time I start

  - (pre- 3-16-2020) Retroactive first entry. I've been working on this 
  for about a month now, in place of The Odin Project's final Rails project
  to replicate Facebook or some other social media site. I've probably spent
  way more time on this than I would have on the final project, mainly due to
  the more complicated data models I've put together for an efficient way of
  representing recipes and their ingredients. I'm trying to avoid repetition
  so each ingredient has a single entry in a table, and all recipes just 
  reference that one thing. Recipes are basically just a set of text steps
  and a lot of references to ingredients. Quantities of ingredients for a 
  recipe are saved on the join model that connects recipes with ingredients.
  I'm not sure if it's actually more efficient, because of my newness, 
  but it seems pretty clever if I do say so myself.
  + My main motivation behind this project is to follow the common advice of 
  solving problems you have yourself. I also wanted to do something more 
  original than just whatever TOP says to do for a final project, to make
  myself stand out more. But mostly it's because I'm trying to learn to cook
  more than just beans and rice, and my travels through the food side of the
  internet have shown me that pretty much every recipe website is a train
  wreck of ads and paragraphs of pointless prose about the author's personal
  history with chicken stew.
