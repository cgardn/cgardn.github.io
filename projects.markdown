## Big Projects

**[List Reactor](https://cgardn.github.io/list-reactor)**
A drag-and-drop digital todo-list/planner, sort of like a more calendar-focused Trello. It started as an experiment for learning React, but now I'm working on turning into something that at least my wife and I both want to use. Still in alpha at the moment, remaining features are drag-reordering of todos and a backend for user auth and saving todos beyond a page refresh.

**[Hyperchef](https://secret-hollows-21988.herokuapp.com)**  
I hate hunting through paragraphs of prose on recipe sites, so I made one that cuts through the fluff. Built on Rails, styled with Bootstrap, includes user accounts with Devise for saving favorite recipes. Upcoming features include meal plans, a shopping-list generator, and many more recipes!
