## Big Projects
**[Hyperchef](https://secret-hollows-21988.herokuapp.com)**  
I hate hunting through paragraphs of prose on recipe sites, so I made one that cuts through the fluff. Built on Rails, styled with Bootstrap, includes user accounts with Devise for saving favorite recipes. Upcoming features include meal plans, a shopping-list generator, and many more recipes!  


## Student Projects
**[Etch-a-DOM](https://cgardn.github.io/etch-a-sketch)**  
A DOM-based doodlepad in vanilla JS, created for The Odin Project.  
[see code on github](https://github.com/cgardn/etch-a-sketch)  

**[Web Calculator](https://cgardn.github.io/web-calculator)**  
A plain HTML and vanilla JS calculator built for The Odin Project.
