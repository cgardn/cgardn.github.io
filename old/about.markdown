Here's the 30,000 foot overview of me:

After a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Rutgers, I started out with 5 years as a medical device Field Engineer. I worked on blood chemistry analyzers - large robotic platforms in hospitals and laboratories. If you get me started, I WILL talk your ear off about clinical chemistry!

In January 2017, I left the lab behind to be a wedding photographer with my wife [Cassi Claire](https://www.cassiclaire.com). We spent four amazing years shooting and travelling the world together!

At the end of 2019, I started a self-directed webdev course [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) to finally realize my lifelong dream of professional development, and building some of the 10,000 ideas I've never had the skills or time to make. I finished up that course in May 2020.

After a brief stint working with a small startup I connected with through the Mozilla Builders Program, I've now been working as a frontend developer in eCommerce since April 2021.

Finally, sundry stats:
